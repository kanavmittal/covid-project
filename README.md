Demo- https://kanavmittal.github.io/covid-project/

This is the Home page of the website. Here the user can see the latest figures/statistics from around the world. Statistics showing number of people having COVID-19 presently, Total Deaths and Total number of recovered patients. Further we will show the Total Confirmed Cases and along with this a Real time Graph.

We believe that this website is apt for the Current Scenario going on around the world. The covid-19 screening test will be very much helpful since the third wave has started hitting most countries.

Hopefully, if this Pandemic is over soon, we would extend this website to some other generic medical/health related issue.
